#### Narrative 

### Skills Demonstrated to meet Course Outcomes

⭐Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
  - Created code review video which evaluates the source code for each enhancement. The review appraised the code structure, documentation, variables, arithmetic operations, loops/branches, and security.
  - Produced easily readable code through use of contectual and organizational comments.
  - Analyzed binary search tree model efficiencies through nanosecond measurement and big-O analysis to support decision making with stakeholders in mind. 
⭐Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
  - Gained and implemented feedback on code review through collaborative environment.
  - Created UML flow and sequence diagrams to document the structural plan for artifact enhancements. 
⭐Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
  - Wrote pseudocode to document the functional changes to be made to assist in feature implementation.
  - Designed and implemented algorithm for two seperate binary search tree models using logical analysis.
  - Implemented Realm data models and learned the itricacies of the open-source database through testing and de-bugging. 
⭐Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
  - Created and employed test cases for data insertion and retrieval into/from the binary search trees including real-data tests using CSV format.
  - Implemented industry standards and best coding practices through use of accepted design patterns and checklist-based review.
  - Utilized third party tools like Realm Studio to manage data and create test-cases. 
⭐Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
  - Evaluated source code for security vulnerabilities using OWASP resources and reported findings in code review.
  - Implemented secure design practices through data and input validation, code modulation, error handling, and user authentication.
  - Tested encryption techniques for data security through Realm's encryption capabilities.
  - Defined database migration strategy for future database updates.
