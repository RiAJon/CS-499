# Computer Science ePortfolio

## Self Assessment 

Through the completion of the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have learned, not only about the craft of designing and writing software, but also about how to collaborate with other developers to gain tools and insights for my work. Over the course of earning my degree, I learned uncountable new skills such as database design and management, security analysis, 3D graphic rendering, neural network implementation, and more. Most recently, I have combined many of these skills to create several full stack projects including Web and Mobile applications.

Effective teamwork is essential for success in software development and IT-related fields. Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have collaborated with cross-functional teams using Agile methodologies, version control systems such as Git, and project management tools. I have experience participating in code reviews, engaging in constructive peer feedback, and integrating multiple components of a project to ensure cohesive functionality.

In the field of computer science, technical proficiency must be accompanied by strong communication skills. My ability to translate complex technical concepts into understandable language allows me to effectively interact with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Whether through presentations, technical documentation, or reports, I ensure that key project details are conveyed clearly and concisely.

I have experience gathering and analyzing user requirements, which has taught me how to align software solutions with business needs. Additionally, I have worked on projects where I needed to document software development lifecycles, API usage, and data structures, ensuring that all relevant parties—including developers, clients, and end-users—can access and comprehend critical project information.

A strong foundation in data structures and algorithms is vital for writing efficient, scalable software. My coursework and hands-on projects have provided me with deep experience in designing and implementing efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and optimizing computational tasks. I have applied my knowledge of trees, graphs, hash tables, and dynamic programming to solve complex problems effectively.

My proficiency in software engineering principles extends to designing and implementing robust, scalable applications. I have developed full-stack applications using programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, and C++. I am well-versed in software development methodologies, including Agile and DevOps, and have experience with frameworks like React and Spring Boot.

Database management is another area of expertise where I have demonstrated my ability to design, normalize, and optimize relational and NoSQL databases. I have worked extensively with SQL and NoSQL databases including MongoDB, Realm, MySQL, and SQLite, ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage. Understanding how to implement database indexing, query optimization, and stored procedures has helped me develop scalable back-end solutions.

Security is a fundamental aspect of modern computing, and I am well-versed in secure coding practices, cryptography, authentication protocols, and risk assessment. I have implemented security measures such as encryption, secure authentication methods (OAuth, JWT), and network security protocols to protect applications from vulnerabilities.

Additionally, my coursework in cybersecurity has equipped me with the knowledge to perform security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments. I understand the importance of writing secure software and following industry best practices to mitigate threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows.
